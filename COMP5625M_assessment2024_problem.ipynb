    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this part of assessment you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Understand the principles of text pre-processing and vocabulary building (provided).\n",
    "> 2. Gain experience working with an image to text model.\n",
    "> 3. Use and compare text similarity metrics for evaluating an image to text model, and understand evaluation challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "This assessment will use a subset of the [COCO \"Common Objects in Context\" dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) for image caption generation. COCO contains 330K images, of 80 object categories, and at least five textual reference captions per image. Our subset consists of nearly 5070 of these images, each of which has five or more different descriptions of the salient entities and activities, and we will refer to it as COCO_5070.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. **Images and annotations**: download the zipped file provided in the link here as [``COMP5625M_data_assessment_2.zip``](https://leeds365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/scssali_leeds_ac_uk/EWWzE-_AIrlOkvOKxH4rjIgBF_eUx8KDJMPKM2eHwCE0dg?e=DdX62H). \n",
    "\n",
    "``Info only:`` To understand more about the COCO dataset you can look at the [download page](https://cocodataset.org/#download). We have already provided you with the \"2017 Train/Val annotations (241MB)\" but our image subset consists of fewer images compared to orginial COCO dataset. So, no need to download anything from here! \n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. **Image meta data**: as our set is a subset of full COCO dataset, we have created a CSV file containing relevant meta data for our particular subset of images. You can download it also from Drive, \"coco_subset_meta.csv\" at the same link as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either submit the same file or make a two separate .ipython notebook files zipped in the submission (please name as ``yourstudentusername_partI.ipynb`` and ``yourstudentusername_partII.ipynb``). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Final note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Please include in this notebook everything that you would like to be marked, including figures. Under each section, put the relevant code containing your solution. You may re-use functions you defined previously, but any new code must be in the relevant section.** Feel free to add as many code cells as you need under each section.\n"

    "The basic principle of our image-to-text model is as pictured in the diagram below, where an Encoder network encodes the input image as a feature vector by providing the outputs of the last fully-connected layer of a pre-trained CNN (we use [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)). This pretrained network has been trained on the complete ImageNet dataset and is thus able to recognise common objects. \n",

    "You can alternatively use the COCO trained pretrained weights from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html). One way to do this is use the \"FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_V2_Weights.COCO_V1\" but use e.g., \"resnet_model = model.backbone.body\". Alternatively, you can use the checkpoint from your previous coursework where you fine-tuned to COCO dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "These features are then fed into a Decoder network along with the reference captions. As the image feature dimensions are large and sparse, the Decoder network includes a linear layer which downsizes them, followed by *a batch normalisation layer to speed up training*. Those resulting features, as well as the reference text captions, are then passed into a recurrent network (we will use an **RNNs** in this assessment). \n",
