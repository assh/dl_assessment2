    "### Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this part of assessment you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Understand the principles of text pre-processing and vocabulary building (provided).\n",
    "> 2. Gain experience working with an image to text model.\n",
    "> 3. Use and compare text similarity metrics for evaluating an image to text model, and understand evaluation challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "This assessment will use a subset of the [COCO \"Common Objects in Context\" dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) for image caption generation. COCO contains 330K images, of 80 object categories, and at least five textual reference captions per image. Our subset consists of nearly 5070 of these images, each of which has five or more different descriptions of the salient entities and activities, and we will refer to it as COCO_5070.\n",

    "``Info only:`` To understand more about the COCO dataset you can look at the [download page](https://cocodataset.org/#download). We have already provided you with the \"2017 Train/Val annotations (241MB)\" but our image subset consists of fewer images compared to orginial COCO dataset. So, no need to download anything from here! \n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. **Image meta data**: as our set is a subset of full COCO dataset, we have created a CSV file containing relevant meta data for our particular subset of images. You can download it also from Drive, \"coco_subset_meta.csv\" at the same link as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission\n",

    "\n",

One way to do this is use the \"FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_V2_Weights.COCO_V1\" but use e.g., \"resnet_model = model.backbone.body\". Alternatively, you can use the checkpoint from your previous coursework where you fine-tuned to COCO dataset. \n",

    "These features are then fed into a Decoder network along with the reference captions. As the image feature dimensions are large and sparse, the Decoder network includes a linear layer which downsizes them, followed by *a batch normalisation layer to speed up training*. Those resulting features, as well as the reference text captions, are then passed into a recurrent network (we will use an **RNNs** in this assessment). \n",
